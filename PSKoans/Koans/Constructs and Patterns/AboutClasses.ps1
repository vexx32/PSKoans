    About Classes

    A class in .NET might be considered to be the recipe used to create a type. A type
    is a representation of something, anything. Types are used to describe everything,
    from strings and numbers to Files, Folders, and Processes.

    PowerShell gained the ability to create classes in PowerShell 5.0, this support
    continues into PowerShell Core.

    Like the "About Enumerations" topic, jobs are used to isolate example code. Preventing it
    from affecting the current PowerShell session.
