    Regular Expressions

    Regular expressions, or regex, are sequences of characters that define a search pattern
    which is then used to find or replace parts of strings. This is especially handy for things
    like extracting text from log files, determining if some user input matches some criteria,
    or replacing parts of a string with other values.

    As you learn about regex, you'll see more and more opportunities to use it as you code.

                in this case 'string' is a regular expression!

                Regex is case sensitive, but -match, along with many other PowerShell operators, perform
                case-insensitive matching.

Describe 'Quantifiers' {
    <#
        Until now, all of the regex exmaples have been literal values. For instace, searching for
        the pattern "through" within the string "Running through a forest", the pattern "through" is
        literally the characters t, h, r, o, u, g, and h in that order. Since quantifiers and many other
        symbols in regex have special meanings, it can sometimes be confusing for humans to read
        regular expressions.

        Quantifiers are a subset of what are commonly called "special characters" in regex. When you
        have a quantifier in a regular expression, they do not indicate that the literal character
        should be present. Instead, quantifiers are an indicator that the pattern element (which may
        be a single character or a group of characters) that occurs just before the quantifier itself
        may be repeated or omitted entirely in the target string, depending on the quantifier used.
    #>
    
    Context '*' {

        It 'specifies 0 or more of something' {
            <#
                The * character specifies "0 or more" of the symbol or group that comes 
                immediately before it. In this case, the pattern can be read aloud as "zero or more
                of the letter p, then the letters e, a, r, and s."
            #>
    
            $____ | Should -Be ('pears' -match 'p*ears')
            $____ | Should -Be ('shears' -match 'p*ears')
        }

        It 'does not need to match the entire string' {
            <#
                What happened in that last example? What part of 'shears' matched the pattern 
                'p*ears'? When you use the -match operator, you can see some interesting information
                in the automatic variable $matches. $matches is a collection of the match objects
                that are created when you use the -match operator. This isn't as flexible nor as
                robust as using [regex]::Matches(), but it's handy in a pinch.
                
                In this case, you'll see that the "sh" in "shears" weren't part of the match. The
                pattern "zero or more p's, followed by e, a, r, s," is found in the string, even
                though there are parts of the string that aren't relevant to that matching effort.

                "literally the letter n". When it's preceded by a backslash, however, that "n" takes
                on a special meaning. In this case, \n matches new lines. Actually, it matches the
                encoded character that indicates a new line.
    
                There are many more regex symbols that are single letters preceded by a backslash.
                In fact, the backslash is probably the single most important character in all of
                regex.
