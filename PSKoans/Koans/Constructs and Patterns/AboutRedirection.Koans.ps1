    Redirection

    Redirection ties into the concept of PowerShell's data streams, of which there are six discrete streams.
    Each stream has an assigned number that can be referenced when using redirection operators. In order,
    the distinct streams are:

    Stream #	Description	        Introduced in
    --------	-----------	        -------------
    1           Success             PowerShell 2.0
    2           Error               PowerShell 2.0
    3           Warning             PowerShell 3.0
    4           Verbose             PowerShell 3.0
    5           Debug               PowerShell 3.0
    6           Information         PowerShell 5.0
    *           All                 PowerShell 3.0

    It could also be argued that since PowerShell operates on top of the pre-existing command-line
    interface with various applications it also makes use of the 'stdin', 'stdout', and 'stderr' streams.
    These must be dealt with when handling PowerShell as a console application or when dealing with output
    from other commands, but in most common cases native command output will be handled by PowerShell as
    being sent to stream #1, the success stream.

    Stream 1 is commonly referred to the "output" stream, as the majority of cmdlets and native commands
    send their output to this stream. Data can always be redirected to this stream from any other
    PowerShell stream.

    However, all streams above stream #1 are strongly-typed and only allow data to be sent as a specific
    type of object, depending on the stream. This means that not all data handled by the success stream
    can be handled by other streams.
