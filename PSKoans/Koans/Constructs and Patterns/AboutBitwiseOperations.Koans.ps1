    Binary

    Binary is introduced in the AboutBinary topic. This topic extends on AboutBinary, exploring different binary operations
    and more complex scenarios.

    PowerShell includes a number of operators which can be used to perform binary or bitwise operations.

     * band
     * bor
     * bxor
     * bnot
     * shl
     * shr

            PowerShell can use the .NET [Convert] type to change a binary string into a numeric
            value.

            The [Convert]::ToByte($String, $Base) method is used to change the value into a byte. The method
            used here has two arguments:

                1. The value to convert, a string.
                2. The base of the number, 2 for binary.

            The [Convert] type contains other methods for converting to different
            numeric types. These can be explored using Get-Member.

        <#
            A byte is an example of an unsigned integer. The values can range from 0 to 255, the value cannot
            be a negative number.

            Signed integers reserve a single bit to denote whether the value is positive or negative.
            When the value of the signing bit is 0, the value is positive. When the value is 1, the value is
            negative.

            The signing bit takes the place of the most significant bit.

            This value is known as SByte, or signed byte. The signed byte allows numbers in the range -128 to 127.
