    About Enumerations

    Enumerations, or Enums, are used to give names to lists of constant values.
    Enumerations are very widely used in the .NET framework and frequently
    encountered in PowerShell.

    Examples in this topic use Start-Job to avoid problems when continually
    loading a type in the current PowerShell session. Enumeration values
    demonstrated in this section are cast to String within the jobs, otherwise
    PowerShell will return only the numeric value from the job.

        The DayOfWeek enumeration (enum) which holds values describing the days
        of the week is a simple example of an existing .NET enumeration.

                If Strict Mode (Set-StrictMode) has been enabled, accessing a
                non-existent value will raise an error.

                Parse is normally used to convert a string into an enum value.
                Parse is not required in PowerShell as values can be directly
                cast to the enum type as shown in the first example.

                TryParse returns true if a value was successfully parsed, and
                false otherwise. TryParse expects three arguments:

                1. The enum type.
                2. The string value to parse.
                3. A reference to a variable which can hold the parse
                    result.

                    This is because the method is actually a generic method,

            The flags attribute can be used to indicate that an enumeration
            represents a series of flags.

            This allows more than one value in the enumeration to be used at
            once.

            .NET makes extensive use of flags based enumerations, from Internet
            security protocols, to file system rights.
        #>

        It 'represents each flag value with a single bit' {
            <#
                A name in the enumeration normally represents a single bit in a
                numeric value.

                PowerShell enumerations use Int32 by default. PowerShell Core
                can use other integer types as demonstrated in the previous
                context.

                32 unique flags can be expressed in an enumeration based on
                Int32. Each value will be double that of the last. Therefore
                expected values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on. These are the
                values of individual bits.

                The [Flags()] attribute is placed above the enum keyword.

                The example below is based on 4 different flags.
