    *-Csv Cmdlets

    Storing data from PowerShell is not always simple. The cmdlets best suited to
    store and retrieve any data you need stored to disk will depend on the format
    of the data.

    For uniform collections of objects with fairly simple property types,
    the CSV cmdlets work well, and can create data that is easily imported to
    Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet applications.

    CSV is short for Comma-Separated Values, and is used to store tabular data.
    Unlike Microsoft Excel workbooks, only a single table can be stored in a file;
    multiple tables are not supported under common CSV definitions, and cannot be
    handled directly by PowerShell's CSV cmdlets without some extra work.

        <#
            Export-Csv is very handy for quickly storing data as CSV to the local filesystem.
            Objects of any type may be exported as CSV, but all property values are stored as
            string data; keep that in mind when working with complex data types.

            Generally speaking, you cannot export objects of different types to the same CSV file;
            the properties used when exporting the CSV data are determined by the first object the cmdlet
            is given. Attempting to export objects of another type, or those with different properties,
            will usually result in largely empty entries in the CSV file unless the property names happen
            to match.
