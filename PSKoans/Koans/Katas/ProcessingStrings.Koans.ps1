    Kata: Processing Strings

    Below is a list containing comma separated data about Microsoft's stock prices
    during March of 2012. Without modifying the list, programatically find the day
    with the greatest variance between the opening and closing price.

    The following operations may be of use:

    [double] $value           # Casts (converts) the value into numerical data
    $String -split ','        # Creates an array by splitting the string

    Be sure to review AboutStrings, AboutArrays and the other foundation Koans
    you've done so far if you get stuck!
