    Select-Object

    Select-Object is a utility cmdlet which serves a number of different purposes.

        * Select or skip a fixed number of objects from a pipeline
        * Select unique objects from an array or collection
        * Select individual properties from an object
        * Create a new object with additional, custom, properties

            Unique works on some more complex objects.

            Ideally objects should be directly comparable, although this is
            rare outside of Strings, numeric types, enumeration types, and other value types.

            Select-Object falls back on the ToString method of an object.

        __ | Should -Be $UniqueProcesses.Count

        <#
            As Process objects are not directly comparable, they are made unique by comparing a
            string representation of the process.

            The string to compare is created as shown below:

                $object = Get-Process -Id $PID
                [PSObject]::AsPSObject($object).ToString()

            For PSCustomObjects the conversion to string is slightly different:

                $object = [PSCustomObject]@{ Name = 'one'}
                [PSObject]::AsPSObject($object.PSBase).ToString()

            This value includes the name of the process, but not the
            ProcessId.

            If several processes of the name name are running these
            will be removed by the Unique parameter.

            If the Property parameter is used, Unique is evaluated after creating a new
            custom object.

            The property parameter can read a hashtable which describes a property.

            The hashtable requires a Name, and Expression to calculate a value for the property.
            The Expression is most often a script block, a short script enclosed in curly braces.

            The variable $_, or $PSItem, is used to refer to the object from the pipeline within the
            Exrpression. Properties may be used even if they are not selected.

            The [PSCustomObject] type accelerator was made available with PowerShell 3. It provides
