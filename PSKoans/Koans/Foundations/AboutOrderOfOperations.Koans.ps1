    Order of Operations

    In PowerShell, the order of operations needs to be taken into account,
    sometimes even more so than other languages. Because all native functions
    and cmdlets take space-separated arguments, any expressions needing
    evaluation need to be explicitly separated with parentheses in many cases.

    In general, PowerShell follows PEMDAS, although it has no native exponential
    operator. Parentheses always get evaluated first (from inner to outer if
    nested), but expressions cannot be passed as arguments without being forced
    to evaluate first.
