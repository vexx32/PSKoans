    String Operators

    While the standard comparison operators can be used with strings, there are also
    several operators that work exclusively with strings.

    The string operators are below:

    Operator            Name                        Purpose
    --------            ----                        -------
    -eq, -ne            Equal, Not Equal            Compare string
    -gt, -lt            GreaterThan, LessThan       Compare string sort order
    -ge, -le            Greater/LessOrEqual         Compare string sort order
    -f                  Format                      Insert and format variables/expressions
    [ ]                 Index                       Access characters in string
    $( )                Subexpression               Insert complex expressions into string
    -join               Join                        Join string array into single string
    -replace            Replace                     Regex: replace characters
    -split              Split                       Regex: split string into array
    -match, -notmatch   Match, Notmatch             Regex: compare string with regex expression

Describe 'String Comparison Operators' {
    <#
        String comparisons work a bit differently to other comparisons. Rather than comparing
        the value of data, the strings are sorted, and the result of the sort determines
        whether a given comparison returns $true.

        In other words, 'ab' -lt 'bc'  is $true because the first string comes before the
        second in a simple ascending sort). -eq and -ne work basically as expected.

        Unless specified, all operators are case-insensitive. To make a given operator
        case sensitive, prefix it with 'c' (e.g., -ceq, -creplace, -cmatch)

        It 'tells you whether strings are the same' {

            $String -eq $OtherString | Should -Be __
            # Watch out for case sensitive operators!
            $String -ceq $OtherString | Should -Be __

        It 'is useful for a straightforward comparison' {
            $String = 'one more string!'
            $OtherString = "ONE MORE STRING!"

            $String -ne $OtherString | Should -Be __

        <#
            The -split operator is used to break a longer string into several smaller strings.
            It can utilise either a regex match or a simple string character match, but
            defaults to regex.

            See 'Get-Help about_Split' for more information.

            -join is used to splice an array of strings together, optionally with a separator
