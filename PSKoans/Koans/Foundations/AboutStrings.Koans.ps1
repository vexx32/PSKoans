    Strings

    Strings in PowerShell come in two flavours: standard strings, and string literals.
    Standard strings in PoSH are created using double-quotes, whereas string literals
    are created with single quotes.

    Unlike most other languages, standard strings in PowerShell are not literal and
    can evaluate expressions or variables mid-string in order to dynamically insert
    values into a preset string.

            the sequence @' or @" and end with the matching reverse "@ or '@
            sequence.
