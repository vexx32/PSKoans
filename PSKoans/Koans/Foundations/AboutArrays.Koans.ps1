    Arrays and Iterable Collections

    Like many programming languages, PowerShell often uses arrays to keep collections
    of objects together. Arrays tie in closely with PowerShell's pipeline, which
    is one way to iterate over a collection with a good deal of efficiency.

    There are a few 'array-like' collection types available in PowerShell, all
    of which are rooted in .NET classes and data types, and behave much the
    same as they do in C# and VB.NET.

    Arrays in particular have a close relationship with the PowerShell pipeline,
    which will be covered a shortly.

        # The comma operator is used to create an array. Spaces are typically ignored.
        $Ages = 12, 25, 18, 64

        <#
            Individual elements of an array can be accessed with square-bracket index syntax.
            Arrays are zero-indexed; the first element is at index 0, the second at 1, etc.
        #>
        $Ages[0] | Should -Be 12
        __ | Should -Be $Ages[3]

        <#
            The array subexpression operator @() is used to create an array from multiple values
            or expressions. Within the parentheses, either commas, semicolons, or even line
            breaks can be used to divide array elements. Although in many cases in PowerShell
            an expression that only returns one value will not become an array, this operator
            forces the value or object to be wrapped in an array.
        #>
        $Names = @(
            'Steve'
            'John'; 'Jaime' # This is a messy way to do things, but it does work

        <#
            The cost of adding an element to an array in PowerShell like this increases with the
            size of the array.

            Each time a new element is added, the array must be copied to a new larger array to accommodate
            the new values.

            The result of the operation is another fixed size array.

            The available methods can be seen with Get-Member:

                Get-Member -InputObject @()

            For example, each array has a Contains method.
        #>

        $____ -eq $Numbers.Contains(3) | Should -BeTrue

        # The Contains method is case sensitive for arrays containing strings.

        $____ -eq $Strings.Contains('first') | Should -BeTrue
        $____ -eq $Strings.Contains('First') | Should -BeTrue

        # PowerShell's -contains operator is not case sensitive.

        $Strings -contains '____' | Should -BeTrue
        $Strings -contains '____' | Should -BeTrue
