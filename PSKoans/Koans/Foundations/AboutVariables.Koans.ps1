    Variables

    PowerShell variables are defined with a $Dollar sign and some text or numbers.
    Some special characters are allowed in variable names, like underscores.

    The PoSH Practice and Style guide recommends PascalCase for variable names
    when writing PowerShell code.

    Variables can store any value, object, or collection of objects in PowerShell.

        PowerShell variables will infer the data type where possible, for
