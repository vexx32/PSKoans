    Strings

    Strings in PowerShell come in two flavours: expandable strings, and string
    literals. Expandable strings in PowerShell are created using double quotes,
    while string literals are created with single quotes.

    Expandable strings in PowerShell can evaluate expressions or variables
    mid-string in order to dynamically insert values into a preset string, like
    a sort of impromptu template string.

                If a string contains a variable that has not been created,
                PowerShell will still try to expand the value. A variable that
                doesn't exist or has a null value will simply disappear when it
                is expanded.

                This could be the result of a typing mistake.

            <#
                In PowerShell, a colon (:) is used to define a scope or provider
                path for a variable. For example, the Environment provider uses
                the syntax $env:SomeVariableName, which refers to an environment
                variable named 'SomeVariableName'. Environment variables are
                initially set by the operating system and usually passed to
                child processes, offering a limited way for processes to
                communicate in a limited way.

                When : is part of a string, PowerShell will try and expand a
                variable in that scope or from that provider.

                All text strings in PowerShell are actually just a series of
                character values. Each of these values has a specific number
                assigned in the [char] type that represents that letter, number,
                or other character.

                .NET uses UTF16 encoding for [char] and [string] values.
                However, with most common letters, numbers, and symbols, the
                assigned [char] values are identical to the ASCII values.

                ASCII is an older standard encoding for text, but you can still
                use all those values as-is with [char] and get back what you'd
                expect thanks to the design of the UTF16 encoding. An extended
                ASCII code table is available at: https://www.ascii-code.com/

                ASCII code table above.

                Get-Help about_Special_Characters will list the escape sequence
                you can use to create the right character with PowerShell's
                native string escape sequences.

                The [string].Substring() method has a few variants, or

                string Substring(int startIndex, int length)

                In other words:
                - Both variants return a string.
                - One variant needs two index references, where to start and
                    stop in selecting the substring.
                - The other only requires a starting index, and goes until the
                    end of the original string.

            sequence.
