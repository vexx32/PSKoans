    Binary

    Binary is a base 2 number system, and only uses two numbers: 0 and 1.

    Binary is the basis of all computing and computational storage. It's simple & straightforward,
    and directly represents the underlying hardware states, which can only be on (1) or off (0).

    It's useful to know binary when working with PowerShell to understand how integers are represented,
    which is our next Koan. It's also extremely useful knowledge if you plan on delving deeper into computing;
    the knowledge is applicable to networking, programming, data science, databases, and essentially every
    other area of computing.

    What is represents is a base 2 number.

    For example, the below binary represents a "byte" of data, which contains 8 "bits".
    Each bit will be either 1 or 0, as mentioned earlier.

    So:

     2^7 | 2^6 | 2^5 | 2^4 | 2^3 | 2^2 | 2^1 | 2^0
     128 |  64 |  32 |  16 |   8 |   4 |   2 |   1
    -----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----
       0     0     0     0     0     0     0     1

    Or:

    00000001

    Is actually 1

    And 00000011

    Is three. As both 1 and 2 are on, and 1 + 2 is equal to 3.
