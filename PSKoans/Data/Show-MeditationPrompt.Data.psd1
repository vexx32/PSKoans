The whole moon and the entire sky
Are reflected in one dewdrop on the grass.
'@
        @'
This is how your mind is.
Its light penetrates everywhere
And engulfs everything,
So why does it not know itself?
'@
        @'
Who is hearing?
Your physical being doesn't hear,
Nor does the void.
Then what does?
'@
        @'
Mountains are merely mountains.
'@
        @'
Hell is not punishment; it is training.
'@
        @'
Do not mistake any state for
Self-realisation, but continue
To ask yourself even more intensely,
What is it that hears?
'@
        @'
The most important thing is to find out what is the most important thing.
'@
        @'
If you want to be free,
Get to know your real self.
'@
        @'
Knowledge and ignorance are interdependent;
Delusion and enlightenment condition each other.
'@
        @'
Even if you speak of the wonder of it all,
How do you deal with each thing changing?
'@
        @'
A world of dew,
And within every dewdrop
A world of struggle.
'@
        @'
When you smash the citadel of doubt,
Then the Buddha is simply yourself.
'@
        @'
I see mountains once again as mountains,
And waters once again as waters.
'@
        @'
When the many are reduced to one,
To what is the one reduced?
'@
        @'
Everything the same,
Everything distinct.
'@
        @'
Make the mountains dance.
'@
        @'
No one is injured but by himself.
'@
        @'
Each branch of coral holds up the moon.
'@
        @'
Out of nowhere, the mind comes forth.

A man sits atop a hundred-foot pole; how can he go further up?
'@
        @'
A pupil in such a great hurry learns slowly.
'@
        @'
The wind does not move,
The banner does not move;
Only your mind moves.
'@
        @'
Without speaking, without silence,
How can you express the truth?
'@
        @'
Sickness and medicine correspond to each other.
The whole world is medicine.
What is the self?
'@
        @'
Choosing to raise a goose in a bottle,
How will you get it out once it is grown?
'@
        @'
Nothing is exactly as it seems, nor is it otherwise.
'@
        @'
To a mind that is still, the whole universe surrenders.
'@
        @'
To create is to see what all can see but think what none have thought.
'@
        @'
If you understand, things are just as they are.
If you do not understand, things are just as they are.
'@
        @'
Maybe you are searching among the branches,
For what only appears in the roots.
'@
        @'
The giver should be thankful.
'@
        @'
As the light of a small candle will spread from one to another in succession,
So the light of the Buddha's compassion will pass from one mind to another endlessly.
'@
        @'
To doubt the walking of the mountains means
That one does not yet know one's own walking.
'@
        @'
Grasping nothing, discarding nothing.
In every place there's no hindrance, no conflict.
My supernatural power and marvelous activity:
Drawing water and chopping wood.
'@
        @'
There's doing nothing,
And then there's doing nothing.
One blade releases
The energies of the Earth,
The other rusts in a stump.
'@
        @'
The Path of Excess
Is the exact opposite
Of the Eightfold Path.
Right View, Right Speech, Right Action...
All simple matters of scale.
'@

The oceans may rage,
But underneath the waters
The Leviathans
Frisk and frolick together
In the Land of Tranquil Light.

The coin lost in the river
Is found in the river.

How can you express the truth?
