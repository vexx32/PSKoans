Its light penetrates everywhere
And engulfs everything,
So why does it not know itself?

And within every dewdrop
A world of struggle.

And waters once again as waters.

To what is the one reduced?

Everything the same,
Everything distinct.

Sickness and medicine correspond to each other.
The whole world is medicine.
